<h1>STATS CORRELATION Extension Command</h1>

<p>Calculate Pearson correlations and confidence intervals.
The correlations are actually calculated by the built-in CORRELATIONS
procedure, the output from which is used in calculating the confidence
intervals.</p>

<p>STATS CORRELATIONS /HELP.  prints this information and does nothing else.</p>

<pre class="example"><code>STATS CORRELATIONS VARIABLES=x y z
/WITH VARIABLES=w
/OPTIONS CONFLEVEL=90.
</code></pre>
<p>The first <strong>VARIABLES</strong> keyword and <strong>VARIABLES</strong> on the <strong>WITH</strong>
subcommand specify the variables to be correlated.  If only the first VARIABLES
keyword is used, a square correlation matrix is calculated.  If /WITH VARIABLES
is also given, then only the correlations of the first set of variables with the
second set are calculated.  For example, if there are
five variables in the first list and two in the second, ten correlations are produced.
Note that <strong>WITH</strong> is a subcommand here rather than appearing within a variable list.
</p>

<h2>OPTIONS</h2>
<p><strong>CONFLEVEL</strong> specifies the level for the confidence interval as a
percentage.  The default is 95.
</p>
<p><strong>METHOD</strong> specifies how the intervals are calculated.  <strong>FISHER</strong>
uses the approximate normality of the Z transform of the correlation.  <strong>BOOTSTRAP</strong>
calculates bootstrap intervals.  This requires that the Bootstrap option for Statistics be
installed.  Otherwise, an error is generated.</p>

<h2>MISSING</h2>
This subcommand specifies how user missing values are treated.  System missing values
are always excluded.  Missing value deletion can be <strong>PAIRWISE</strong>,
which is the default, or
<strong>LISTWISE</strong>.  Note that these keywords require YES or NO, which is
different from their usage in other procedures.
</p>
<p><strong>EXCLUDE</strong> is the default and excludes user missing values.
<strong>INCLUDE</strong> includes user missing values as if they were valid values.
